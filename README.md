# Freecam

This mod allows you to control your camera separately from your player. While it is enabled, you can fly around and travel through blocks within your render distance. Disabling it will restore you to your original position. This can be useful for quickly inspecting builds and exploring your world. 

The bind defaults to X, and can be changed in the vanilla options menu. Speed and various cosmetic options are configurable through the Mod Menu config page.

This mod works in multiplayer, but may be considered cheating on some servers, so use it at your own risk.
